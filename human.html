                    Above are eight charts of advanced metrics. They show which of the ten 2018 playoff teams
                    has the best chance of winning the World Series.
                    <br>
                    Starting top left and moving clockwise:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="color: black">
                        <li>
                            Average age of a teams batters and pitchers isn't an advanced metric, but it gave a good look at the ages of past World Series Champions.
                            <br>
                            This chart eliminates the Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, and the Atlanta Braves.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Team wins versus saves gives a good idea of how many close wins a team had. Boston only had 33 saves in 2013 before winning the World Series, however more than 40 is what the bulk of championship teams had.
                            <br>
                            This chart eliminates the Atlanta Braves.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Total shutouts shows the ability of a team to lock down an opposing offense.
                            <br>
                            This chart eliminates the Colorado Rockies and the Los Angeles Dodgers.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            The four chart is where the advanced metrics come into play. This chart shows the ability of a team to convert balls in play to outs and the pitcher's value on balls that don't get put in play.
                            <br>
                            This chart eliminates the Colorado Rockies, the Cleveland Indians, the Boston Red Sox, and the New York Yankees.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            This is a very telling chart. It shows the team's offensive value and pitching value. It highlights the two most impressive 2018 regular season teams, the Boston Red Sox and the Houston Astros.
                            <br>
                            This chart eliminates the Chicago Cubs and the Colorado Rockies.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            This chart shows team speed and offensive value. Speed and OPS+ tend to be inversely proportional since fast guys tend to be small and powerful guys tend to be slow.
                            <br>
                            This chart eliminates the Oakland Athletics, the Chicago Cubs, and the Colorado Rockies.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            This chart shows the team's average fielder's defensive value against the team's pitching value.
                            <br>
                            This chart eliminates the Boston Red Sox.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            This chart again shows the team's average fielder's defensive value, but this time plots it against the team's offensive value.
                            <br>
                            This chart eliminates the Boston Red Sox, the Chicago Cubs, and the Colorado Rockies.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text">
                    Eight of the ten playoff teams were eliminated with the charts. The remaining teams are the Houston Astros and the Milwaukee Brewers.
                    Since they represent different leagues, this is the obvious World Series match up choosen by the charts. 
                    When looking to pick one team from the two, the charts show one team as superior across the board, the Houston Astros.
                    The Astros place well in all of the charts, and are in historic territory of a few charts. Therefore, as the human part of the analysis, the Houston Astros reign supreme.
